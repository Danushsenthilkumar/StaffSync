#StaffSync(FAMS)

In response to the growing complexity of managing faculty activities within the Information Technology Department of SSN, this project endeavours to design and implement a robust **Faculty Activities Management System (FAMS)**.

Recognizing the need for an efficient, user-friendly, and technology-driven solution, the system leverages **Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to provide a centralized platform for faculty and administrators.
